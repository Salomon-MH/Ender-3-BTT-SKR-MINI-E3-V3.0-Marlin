# Ender 3 Marlin w/ BIGTREETECH SKR MINI E3 V3.0 board
My hardware configuration

- Creality Ender 3
- BIGTREETECH SKR MINI E3 V3.0 replacement board (originally came with Creality 1.1.4 board)
- 3D Touch sensor ("3DSWAY" clone) with printed [Adjustable BL-Touch sensor mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3148733)
- Original Creality Ender 3 metal extruder upgrade
- Ball bearing filament spool holder upgrade
- Regular 0.4mm brass nozzle

Currently not using a connected raspberry pi or similar board.

## Connections
Most stuff is just connected equal to how it was with the 1.1.4 board, except for where polarities is switched when comparing the boards (careful!) and another connector being used for one fan (soldered a new connector to the wire).

3D Touch sensor is currently connected to the Z-End port, but I'm still tinkering with the 3D Touch sensor.
